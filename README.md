# TData and TLink optimization project

https://github.com/SkybuckFlying/TDataTLinkOptimizationProject

## The aim of the project is to:

1. Optimize the IsEmpty and IsFull routines for TData and TLink.
2. Optimize the Empty and Full routines for TData and TLink.
3. Implement WIN64 platform support by implementing BitSet and BitReset.
 
## Recommendations to take part in this project:
  
1. Download and install the free Delphi Community Edition 10.3 or newer.    
2. Have experience with pascal/delphi coding or asssembler coding for x86/x64 or other processors.    
3. For now the workflow will be to fork this project or set upstream to it and issue pull request to incorporate your conversions into this main project.    
4. In Delphi IDE it is preferred to use tab characters for indentation for fast coding/text editing/navigation.    
    
   In Delphi->Tools->Options:    
   Use Tab Character Checked V    
   Block Ident = 4    
   Tab Stops = 4    
   Cursor through tabs Checked V    
   Optimal Fill Checked V    
   Backspace unindents Checked V    
   
   Tip: With these settings enabled an easy but slower way to convert these spaces to tabs is to enable:\
   Show tab character Checked V  
   Show space character Checked V  
     
   Then process the entire file by simply moving the cursor from top to bottom through the file with the down arrow on the keyboard.  
   Another possibility is to use textpad editor and a plugin called "tabout"  
    
5. Commits should be done with git commit. Enter a short 50 character yellow description line at the top by pressing insert. Leave one blank line below that.  
    Optionally enter a gray longer message below that, max character length should be 72. Then press escape and write :wq    (for write and quite)
